The Pelagios widgets are small embeddable Javascript applications that allow users of your site to access ancient history data from Pelagios partners.

== Description ==

The Pelagios widgets are widgets that you can embed on a web page to display relationships between places and items in ancient history collections.

There are two widgets, one to display information about places you mention on your site, the other allows people to search for information related to places.

The information displayed originates from museums, research institutes, universities and projects that are part of Pelagios, and includes details about these items and maps showing associated locations.

= About Pelagios Widgets =

The Pelagios Widgets were developed by the Institute of Educational Technology at The Open University as part of the Pelagios 2 project funded by JISC.
